# Architecture Decision Records (ADR-lite)

This folder stores short, permanent records of important decisions.

Rules:
- If a decision affects architecture, tooling, security posture, or long-term maintainability: write an ADR.
- Keep ADRs short. Prefer clarity over completeness.
- If a decision changes: create a new ADR and mark the old one as Superseded.
