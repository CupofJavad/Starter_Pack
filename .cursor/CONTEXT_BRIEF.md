# Context Brief (Living Memory)

## Project Snapshot
- What this repo/app is: Starter package template for Cursor projects
- Current status: Baseline scaffolding + doctrine files included
- What "done" means: New projects can be bootstrapped, debugged, and resumed easily

## Key Decisions
- Use env-vars only for credentials
- Use Error KB + Conversation Vault for long-term memory
- Follow Failure-to-Fix Protocol for all failures

## Open Threads
- None yet (update this per project)

## Next Steps
1) Clone this template for a new project
2) Update Context Brief to match that project
3) Start conversation log + begin development loop
