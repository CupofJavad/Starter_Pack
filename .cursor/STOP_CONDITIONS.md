# Stop Conditions

Stop debugging and escalate if:
- Missing credentials or permissions (HF/NameSilo/SSH)
- External service outage / rate limiting
- Requirements ambiguous or contradictory
- Fix requires irreversible change without approval
- Authoritative sources conflict with no clear resolution

When stopped:
- summarize what is known
- list blockers
- propose the next human action
